"""
End to end smoke test for the Secure Agentic-AI platform.

Run it against a scratch database so it never touches real data:

    venv/bin/python smoke_test.py

It checks the behaviour the platform is judged on:

- questions are answered from verified sources, or refused
- questions never create institutional actions
- requests collect their required fields before being filed
- nothing executes without human approval
- execution creates real institutional records
- policy rules from the knowledge base are actually enforced
- messages in other languages are declined, not guessed at

Requires the local Ollama model to be running.
